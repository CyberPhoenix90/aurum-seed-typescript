Npm scripts:

| Script        | Effect                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| npm run build | Builds the project                                                           |
| npm run dev   | Starts a web server with hotreload and watch build                           |
| npm run test  | Runs all unit tests                                                          |

You can customize the webpack config to swap out or change technologies. The CSS Loader supports SCSS so you can import SCSS or CSS right from your code
